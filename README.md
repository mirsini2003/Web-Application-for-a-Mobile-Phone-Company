# Web-Application-for-a-Mobile-Phone-Company
This is a web application in C# ASP .NET for a mobile phone company
The aim of the project is the development of a complete web application for issuing bills and managing mobile telephony customers. The application will be targeted at different types of users ( clients, sellers and administrators ) with distinct rights and functions for each role .The application will be available over the web and will operate in a web environment. 
It is developed using Visual C# within the ASP.NET Core Web Application framework, applying the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design architecture through Visual Studio 2022, using an SQL Database for storing data.

It's a very useful way to observe how different technologies can be combined such as C#, HTML , CSS and JavaScript.
I will be very happy if you have any additions or improvements to my code.
